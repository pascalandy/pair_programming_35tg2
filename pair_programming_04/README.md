# Job Title
Help me to setup AWS S3 storage with my Ghost blog

### Details about this request
All detail: https://github.com/pascalandy/pair_programming_35tg2/tree/master/pair_programming_04

Here is a screen cast (56 sec) about the setup http://jmp.sh/uyhocJC.

The server is that host the blog is NOT running on AWS. My blog is running smoothly. Except the AWS S3 component set up for uploading images from my Ghost blog. 

I understand there is configs for the IAM + S3 bucket. Again the picture are uploaded on S3 but do not appear back in the blog. I pretty sure I have an issue with my AWS config so we will do this in real time over TeamViewer.

**Requirement 01**) As a user I should be able to upload picture normally. (under the hood it's in s3)

**Requirement 02**) Have this site uploading into a folder. I don't want to create a new bucket for each sites.
