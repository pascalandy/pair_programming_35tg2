## How to quote your price

1. Let's not negotiate, chat or waste anyone's time about this quote. I'm not looking for the cheapest person.
2. If you know what you are doing, you should resolve this **within 10-20 minutes**.
3. I'm welling to pay **20$ US** for this task via upwork.com, hackhands.com or Paypal
4. This request is wide open and the source is available to everyone.

## Before you start!
- Don't work for nothing! Officially confirm you take charge by **assigning yourself** into the [appropriate issue](https://github.com/pascalandy/pairing-work/issues/).
- If you don't do this, you may work on the same issue as someone else at the same time! I can't pay for this miscommunication. You'll have been warned. :)

## Details about this request

First consider this as a pair programming gig :) I'm using docker-compose v2 with many components like nginx reverse proxy, discovery services (without hard coded IP or Ports), PostgreSQL, Logentries, Load balancer all running remotly into containers. I'm not a newbie and you might as well learn from me :)

Here is a screen cast (56 sec) about the setup http://jmp.sh/uyhocJC. 

I pretty sure I have an issue with my AWS config so we will do this in real time over TeamViewer. 

Cheers!
Pascal
