## Before you start!

## Details about this request

First consider this as a pair programming gig :) I'm using docker-compose v2 with many components like nginx reverse proxy, discovery services (without hard coded IP or Ports), PostgreSQL, Logentries, Load balancer all running remotly into containers. I'm not a newbie and you might as well learn from me :)
