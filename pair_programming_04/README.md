## Title
Help me to setup AWS S3 storage with my Ghost blog

## Details about this request
All detail: https://github.com/pascalandy/pair_programming_35tg2/tree/master/pair_programming_04

First consider this as a pair programming gig :) I'm using docker-compose v2 with many components like nginx reverse proxy, discovery services (without hard coded IP or Ports), PostgreSQL, Logentries, Load balancers all running remotely into containers. I'm not a newbie and you might as well learn from me :)

***

Here is a screen cast (56 sec) about the setup http://jmp.sh/uyhocJC. 

My server which is hosting the blog is NOT on AWS ! Everything runs smoothly except this S3 component set up for uploading images from my Ghost blog. I understand there is configs for the IAM + S3 bucket. Again the picture are uploaded on S3 but do not appears back in the blog.

I pretty sure I have an issue with my AWS config so we will do this in real time over TeamViewer.

Thank you!
